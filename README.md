*READ_ME:*
The term "Google it" is well understood and now we are going to be saying "Slack it". This is a tiny tutorial to help us be Slack Masters faster. Check Slack often. Check out MW channel eveyday for instructional staff messages. If I post something in this channel you are respobsible to know it. Any other channel is not with that expectation so don't worry only make sure you keep up with our MW channel and my posts please. Use the desktop version not web please. 



1. Put a photo and your job title (just put your desired job title - this is not visible to anyone else but don't put learning jsut put the real title please).

2. Go look at the Profile of at least 1 other person in the course.

3. Start a DM with that person and use the `@` sign plus their username. 

4. Send your desired position dream dev job or if not looking for a job, a cool project you want to build with your new skills  5 different times, once with each type of higlighting availbale see photo bottom right.
